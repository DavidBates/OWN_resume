## Who I am

A technology passionate geek. A generalist seeking a fulfilling career of problem solving, coding, project management, architecture, and making complex systems used by many others. I want to make an impact on the world and you can help me do that.

## What I do

I build complex systems (web, desktop, enterprise, industrial automation, and mobile) using the latest development practices. I lead and mentor technical teams by example while breaking down large unknowns into manageable work. I help high level stakeholders turn mission statements into actual roadmaps. I work with sales and clients to ensure I’ve delivered the best in class software that exceeds their demands. I push the forefront of what's possible by continually educating myself on cutting edge tech and I contribute to a culture of excitement by sharing my passion with others.   I am a true geek in every sense of the word and I love what I do.

## Skills & Abilities

### Programming Languages

I am proficient at most common C or ECMA Script based languages and can switch between them naturally. My philosophy on coding is that it doesn’t matter what language you use as long as you can logically break down the issue. The following chart shows programming languages I have used and my proficiency with each.

### Management

I’m experienced with managing teams of all sizes. Such as, taking on large scale rollouts in industrial automation projects that required contract employees to longer term projects. All the while overseeing multiple tech teams. In each case I try to foster a culture of innovation by mentoring my teams through exposure while mitigating risks and advancing their careers. I bring extensive experience to the table but also know when to step back and let my    team fulfill their tasks.

### System Design & Architecture

From large-scale enterprise B2B applications, industrial automation applications, down to mobile applications meant for a single trade show I have run the gamut of architectures and system designs. I am proficient with any machine or language and take a unique approach to solving problems. This makes me incredibly proficient at creating the correct design the first    time.

## Marketing

My marketing experience stems from my experiences in retail and customer service transposed on top of years of exploring marketing avenues and studying user behavior. I build personas that match the target audience and then look at the product / solution through their eyes. Doing this along with my passion for technology allows me to stay on top of the latest trends and target customer profiles accurately. Once you know the value proposition and how to build trust, wrapping that into a marketing campaign with a creative    twist is just icing on the cake.

## R&D

Being a generalist leads well into running R&D projects and teams. With broad knowledge across many disciplines and a general thirst to solve hard problems I have proven my ability to solve for the unknown. I have never let failure be a blocker to success. I've brought    numerous new revenue streams and enhancements to my previous employers. I’m always known as an “Idea Guy” but I also have the skill and experience to see ideas become innovation.

## Experience
