					<blockquote>Thanks for having me today. If you haven’t met me yet, I’m David Bates and I’ve super happy to talk about resumes, websites, AI, and you! 
						I’ve been in the industry for almost 30 years and in that time have seen hundreds if not thousands of resumes. While it’s odd to give this talk here (We’re all employed) we’re each on our own paths and I want you all to succeed. I chose this talk because the resume and your digital identity are tools everyone should be utilizing. Today I’m going to give you some tips and tricks that will hopefully help you build a kick-ass resume and an kick-start an online presence that you can iterate on as you gain more experience. This talk is geared towards those starting out but I’m sure anyone will take away a tip. Let’s dive in.

						You’re resume is much like a dating profile. I must admit I haven’t dated in 24 years but I do have tiktok so… I’m basically still hip…
						You are basically marketing yourself in your resume, the people that read it will have many to go through so you want to make sure you leave an impression so they can’t help but swipe right. 
						First we’re going to talk about the resume itself and how to improve it
						Then we’ll get into networking both in-person and online 
						Finally I’ll show you how to take your resume and create an online presence with it that you own.

						During this presentation I’ll talk a lot about how to best use AI to customize and optimize your resume. I’ll introduce you to some concepts for prompt engineering that will help the output from AI be somewhat safe but using any generative AI comes with risks and you should always evaluate the output. 
						Some risk include: 
						Hallucinations (The bot will make up stuff) 
						Relying on job input and not verifying you have the skills it’s saying you do
						Taking layouts from others 
						Bad or broken english 
						With that being said if you take the output and put your own spin on it and utilize frameworks to aid then they can be a tremendous help.

						For this demonstration I’m going to take my own resume and feed it into an AI to help me target a specific job. The highlighted sections are my base or generic information and this base helps the AI know both my style and the range of capabilities I’m willing to share. Let’s take a look at the prompt. But first let’s talk about prompt engineering.

						Prompt engineering can be tricky and I’m sure we’ve all been underwhelmed by the output of AI from time to time… It just doesn’t get me, or I can’t articulate what I want. Well there are frameworks out there to help you. RISEN has been my goto when I’m struggling to get AI to give me what I want because it forces me to think about the output and what the AI is capable of. Frameworks and prompt engineering can be a talk on it’s own but for today we’ll structure out prompts in this format. 
						Now let’s see the demo.

						I’ve said it a couple of times now but depending on the job and industry a hiring manager may have to shift through hundreds if not thousands of resumes. You want to make sure your’s come’s up for the role at hand. You also don’t want to be caught keyword stuffing. The last generation we showed is a good example of using it the right way. Making sure content from the job posting is in the text of your resume. You could also include a section at the bottom of your resume that list keywords… and guess what? You can use AI to help generate those keywords.

						First order retrieval is the principle that you should put the things you use the most right in arms reach. I chose this term because let’s say you made it past the keyword filter and are in the small pile that will actually get reviewed by the hiring manager or HR. They have some work to do and you don’t want to make it difficult for them to find the information they need. There are three sections that they’ll be looking at. 
						1. Skills… do you have the skills that the job demands?
						2. History… do you have the work history in the roles that matter? 
						3. Education… do you have the degree or similar that they are looking for? 
						Optimize your resume to make sure these things are front and center, and that they are in a format they expect.

						The next big thing is to make sure you call our your impact and include hard numbers… Don’t have hard numbers? Start collecting them. These numbers show impact at each step in your career and that you are a driven person. Exactly what the hiring manager wants to see.

						In-person meetups can be found through local groups, scour resources like meetup.com or facebook groups. Make sure you’ve filled out your linked in and stay active on there joining groups from there to find out about conferences and other events.

							As a resume optimizer, you are tasked with enhancing a user's resume by specifically improving the 'About' section to align with a given job description. Your role combines analytical and creative skills to ensure the section is both accurate and engaging. Here’s what you need to do:
							
							1. Receive the user’s resume and the job description they provide.
							2. Analyze the job description to clearly understand the required skills and experiences.
							3. Review the resume to identify and extract key skills and experiences that match those required by the job.
							4. Use this information to draft an 'About' section that highlights the user’s qualifications most relevant to the job, ensuring it is engaging and accurately reflects the user’s capabilities.
							5. Refine this draft to make sure it is concise and does not exceed 500 words, focusing strictly on matching the resume content with the job description.
							6. The final deliverable should be a targeted 'About' section that effectively positions the user as a suitable candidate, showcasing their relevant qualifications within the constraints provided. 
							
							This approach ensures that the 'About' section is meticulously tailored to the job, enhancing the user's chances of securing an interview.

								Start by structuring the resume content into HTML format, categorizing it appropriately for web presentation. Design the page using inline CSS, ensuring it incorporates
								aesthetic themes from the additional input provided by the user. The layout should include a navigation bar, specific sections for resume content like education and experience,
								a contact form, and designated placeholders for images. Carefully review and adjust the design for visual appeal, functionality, and responsiveness across devices. 
								Finalize the project by generating the complete HTML code for the website, ready for hosting. This code should include all necessary inline CSS and be optimized for 
								easy web publication, effectively showcasing the individual’s professional narrative in a visually engaging manner. Ensure all placeholders for images are clearly marked and that
								the HTML is fully functional as delivered.
